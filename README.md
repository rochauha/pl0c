# pl0c
My attempt at writing a compiler for the PL/0 programming language by Niklaus Wirth. <br>
Initially, the aim was to write the entire compiler from scratch. While working on it, the focus slowly shifted to writing an LLVM frontend. <br>
See [GRAMMAR.md](https://github.com/ronakchauhan97/pl0c/blob/master/GRAMMAR.md) for details on the language spec. <br>
